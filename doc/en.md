## Introduction

My English is poor, but I try to express myself clearly.

At the beginning of the project, I spent two days learning the Git command. The project took me  two and a half days, including half a day, when I was building my personal drawing bed.

For how to build a static blog, please move to my Zhihu article: [https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/133861531](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/133861531) 

## Implementation mode

* Github Page: for rengding content in the specified repository.
* Hexo Framework: static blog framework, based on node.js
* Hexo-Theme: for embelishing my blog.

## Summary

I have been writing articles and taking notes on Zhihu before, but Zhihu always reviews my articles, which makes me uncomfortable. That's why I plan to build a personal blog.

There are still some twists and turns in the build process. When executing the [hexo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yb411a7ty) command, there is always a circular dependency problem due to the too high version of node.js (higher than v12).

[The embellishmen process of blog](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16W411t7mq) also needs time for web page rendering, so it can't preview the effect in real time, which delays time.

The last step of Travis CI bothers me even more. There are various configuration methods on the Internet. I tested 13 times, and finally found [a suitable configuration method for myself](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/94560382), so I successfully configured it.

Although the process is very difficult, I successfully made a static blog siteultimately, and also achieved my expected goal. This website takes two and a half days to build, but I often stay up until more than two o'clock in the evening. It's what you make yourself that makes you feel.

Finally, I really appreciate the people who helped me in this project. Although I didn't even ask them questions, I can also benefit a lot from their articles or videos, so I can avoid many detours.

## Expectation

In the subsequent version, I will add [the dual deployment strategy of GitHub and coding.net](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34065149), so as to realize the domestic and foreign diversion. And I try to embellishment my blog to make it look more comfortable. Then I will add mathematical formulas and other useful plugins.

But I've been busy recently. Maybe I will take action in a long time.
